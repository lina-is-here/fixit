        Openshift - what it is ...

                Observe the file, there are 3 sections, it suppose to create 3 almost identical Openshift pods.
                In each section there is one typo. Open editor vim or nano and fix those typos and save the file.
                Once you think the file was fixed, run `oc apply -f centos_pods.yml --dry-run --validate` command,
                it will tell you if there are more errors.
