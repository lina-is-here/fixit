    name: A Pending Task
    description: |
        You are still trying to remember what happened: it was just a regular Tuesday...
        Tuesday? Oh God, it means today is Wednesday and you should go to work. You drop a message to your team: "Working from home today".
        You open your laptop and see you forgot to finish a task yesterday (strange, you've never left tasks unfinished before).
        So, you defintely worked on Openshift yesterday, huh, such a buzzword nowadays.
        Ok, now you remember you created centos_pods.yml, so you need to finish and create this pods.

        Create the pods using the following commands:

        oc apply -f ... --dry-run --validate
        oc apply -f ...
        oc delete -f ...

        Because you have headache and you do not remember syntax of oc client tool, you must use -
        `oc apply --help` and `oc delete --help`

                Observe the file, there are 3 sections, it suppose to create 3 almost identical Openshift pods.
                In each section there is one typo. Open editor vim or nano and fix those typos and save the file.
                Once you think the file was fixed, run `oc apply -f centos_pods.yml --dry-run --validate` command,
                it will tell you if there are more errors.

                If you somehow screw and you cannot deploy any of the Openshift pods, you can delete these resources by executing,
                `oc delete -f centos_pods.yml` and re-deploy again with `oc apply -f centos_pods.yml`

task2:
    name: Getting the Secret
    description: |
        A lot of questions but at least you finished the pending task. Your manager pings you on the chat:
        - hey, here?
        - yep
        - thanks for the deploying the pods
        - np
        - we heard there's some secret stuff in one of the pods, can you check?
        - sure...

        What kind of secret stuff? But as you want a promotion soon, you are really determined to explore it.
        You remember yesterday one colleague told you some useful commands:
        oc get pods
        oc rsh ...
        Your head still hurts so you ask for mor help -
        `oc rsh --help`

        Explore the pods and find a secret in one of them.

        Damn, you just woke up and need to fight for your food?
        Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde... Wow! How do you know their names?
        Luckily, there's a special magic script that was inside your yummy food to help you out and
        check there're no ghosts around.

        Run "pytest script.py" and get all the tests passed to run away from the ghosts.
